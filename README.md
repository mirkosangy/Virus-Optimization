# Virus-Optimization
The project aims at optimizing the deadliness of a new virus spreading in an isolated net-
work, represented as three connected communities of people. This work also aims at providing
a simplified discrete-time simulation, described by few parameters, as a straightforward alter-
native to more complex models proposed in the literature.
The simulation is used to model the spread of the illness, and the obtained results are then
deeply analyzed to understand how the virus’ behavior varies by changing both the involved
parameters and the network characteristics.
As shown in the results, it will become clear that the network plays a fundamental role for
a successful virus’ spread, together with the characteristics of the patient zero and the virus’
parameters.
